    "# Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain Non-Relational Databases in Short. In Which Scenarios is it Preferred to Use MongoDB Over SQL Databases?\n",
    "# MongoDB\n",
    "# MongoDB is a popular open-source NoSQL database that uses a document-oriented data model. Data is stored in flexible, JSON-like documents, allowing for varied data structures and dynamic schemas.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Non-Relational Databases\n",
    "# Non-relational databases, or NoSQL databases, store data differently than traditional relational databases. Instead of using tables, rows, and columns, they use flexible models such as documents, key-value pairs, wide-columns, or graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Scenarios to Prefer MongoDB Over SQL Databases\n",
    "# Dynamic Schema: When the data structure is not fixed and can evolve over time.\n",
    "# Scalability: For applications requiring horizontal scalability.\n",
    "# Big Data: For handling large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data.\n",
    "# Performance: When performance for read and write operations needs to be optimized.\n",
    "# Flexibility: For storing hierarchical data and managing complex data relationships more easily.\n",
    "# Q2. State and Explain the Features of MongoDB\n",
    "# Key Features of MongoDB\n",
    "# Flexible Schema: MongoDB uses a dynamic schema, allowing documents to have different fields and structures.\n",
    "# Document-Oriented: Data is stored in BSON format (Binary JSON), making it easy to map to native programming language types.\n",
    "# Scalability: MongoDB supports horizontal scaling through sharding, distributing data across multiple servers.\n",
    "# High Performance: Optimized for high read and write throughput.\n",
    "# Indexing: Supports various types of indexing to improve query performance.\n",
    "# Aggregation: Provides a powerful aggregation framework for data processing and analysis.\n",
    "# Replication: Supports replica sets for high availability and data redundancy.\n",
    "# Transactions: Supports multi-document ACID transactions for reliable operations.\n",
    "# Q3. Write a Code to Connect MongoDB to Python. Also, Create a Database and a Collection in MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "#  from pymongo import MongoClient\n",
    "\n",
    "# # Connect to MongoDB\n",
    "# client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')\n",

    "# # Create a database\n",
    "# db = client['example_db']\n",
    "\n",
    "# # Create a collection\n",
    "# collection = db['example_collection']\n",
